Different factors relate to the success of a movie. They may range from genre, to cast, to directors The Movie Database is a dataset that holds most of these information for analysis. From the description on Kaggle, 0 values are meant to be taken as null values but I didn't drop them.

- What Year had the Highest Revenue?
- Is There a Relationship Between Budget and Revenue?
- Do the Cast Influence the Revenue?
- Do the Directors Influence the Revenue?
